# social media web application
Social media web application developed in C# .NET with Razor Pages using an SQL database

This application is a personal project I created for a fun resume project. 
It was hosted on Azure with a SQL database. It can be ran locally with an Sqlite database.
The Startup.cs file has the conditional that checks what environment is being used.
